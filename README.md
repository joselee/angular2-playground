### Angular 2 boilerplate
This project boilerplate is based on the official quickstart project at angular.io.

It uses npm to run tsc to transpile the app bundle to a single file in the dist directory.

Library imports will still get fetched individually, because dependencies are not bundled.

#### Setup
* npm install
* npm start
