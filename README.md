### Angular 2 boilerplate
This project boilerplate is based on the example provided by John Papa in the course 'Angular 2 first look'.

The full list of examples from the course can be found at: http://angular2-first-look.azurewebsites.net/ 

No pre-transpilation or bundling happens at all. Typescript gets compiled in the browser.

#### Setup
Run an http-server from the root directory
